## Permission Management

### Conservative Security Model

Claude Code implements a sophisticated permission system designed for enterprise security:

**Permission Principles:**
- **Conservative Default**: Minimal permissions granted initially
- **Explicit Approval**: Each new action type requires user approval
- **Session-Specific**: Permissions can be configured per session
- **Audit Trail**: All permissions and actions are logged

**Permission Commands:**
```bash
/permissions              # View current permission settings
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions  # Auto-approve mode (use carefully)
```

**Security Features:**
- Trust verification for first-time codebase access
- Command injection detection for suspicious operations
- Fail-closed approach for unrecognized commands
- Sensitive data exclusion recommendations

### CLAUDE.md Project Configuration

## MCP Integration

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Architecture

The Model Context Protocol transforms Claude Code from a coding assistant into a comprehensive development platform with enterprise-grade external system connectivity.

#### Core Integration Framework
```bash
# Add local development server
claude mcp add dev-server -- node ./scripts/dev-server.js

# Add database connection
claude mcp add postgres -- /path/to/postgres-mcp-server \
  --connection-string "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"

# Add GitHub integration  
claude mcp add github -- github-mcp-server --token $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

#### Configuration Scopes

1. **Local Configuration**: Personal, project-specific servers
2. **Project Configuration**: Team-shared via `.mcp.json` in version control
3. **User Configuration**: Cross-project servers for individual preferences

**Example `.mcp.json` for team sharing:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "github-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--token", "$GITHUB_TOKEN"]
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "postgres-mcp-server", 
      "args": ["--connection-string", "$DATABASE_URL"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Enterprise Integration Patterns

**Database and Data Management:**

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Slash Commands

**Implementation**:
- Location: `.claude/commands/[command-name].md`
- Structure: Markdown files with Title, Description, and Instructions
- Namespace format: `/namespace:command-name`
- Personal commands: `~/.claude/commands/` (available globally)
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for command arguments

**Popular Commands**:
```bash
/commit                    # Automated git commits with structured messages
/create-pr                 # Pull request creation workflow
/check                     # Code quality and security analysis
/optimize                  # Performance analysis
/tdd                      # Test-driven development guidance
/project:create-feature    # Feature development workflow
/security:security-audit   # Security vulnerability scanning
/dev:code-review          # Comprehensive code review
```

#### Command Template Pattern
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Task, Read, Write, TodoWrite
description: [Clear description of what command does]
argument-hint: [Expected arguments format]
---

# Command Title

## Context
- Current state: [Context gathering]
- Target: [What we're working on]

## Task
[Clear instructions using $ARGUMENTS variable]

## Expected Output
[What the command should produce]
```

### 2. Hooks System

**Architecture**:
- Location: `.claude/hooks/`
- Configuration: `settings.json` in `.claude/` directory
- Event transmission: Shell scripts for automated responses

**Hook Types & Events**:
- `PreToolUse` (ðŸ”§) - Before tool execution
- `PostToolUse` (âœ…) - After tool execution
- `UserPromptSubmit` (ðŸ’¬) - User input capture
- `Notification` (ðŸ””) - System notifications
- `Stop` (ðŸ›‘) - Execution halts
- `SubagentStop` (ðŸ‘¥) - Sub-agent termination
- `PreCompact` - Before context compaction

**Hook Control**:
- Exit codes control execution flow
- JSON output for custom responses
- Regex/exact string matching for tool filtering
- Interactive configuration via `/hooks` command

#### Essential Hook Events

**PostToolUse - Primary Automation Trigger**
```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "Write|MultiEdit",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": ".claude/hooks/automation-pipeline.sh"
    }]
  }]
}
```

**Triggers when**: Files are created or modified
**Use for**: Validation, auto-formatting, build triggering

**PreToolUse - Safety Validation**
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "Bash.*rm|Write.*config",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command", 
      "command": ".claude/hooks/safety-check.sh"
    }]
  }]
}
```

**Triggers when**: Dangerous operations detected
**Use for**: Preventing destructive actions, security validation

**UserPromptSubmit - Context Enhancement**
```json
{
  "UserPromptSubmit": [{
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": ".claude/hooks/inject-context.sh"  
    }]
  }]
}
```

**Triggers when**: User submits prompt
**Use for**: Auto-injecting project context, status updates

#### Hook Development Best Practices

**Exit Code Standards**:
```bash
exit 0  # Success, continue operation
exit 1  # Warning, continue with notice
exit 2  # Block operation entirely
```

**JSON Response Format**:
```json
{
  "decision": "continue|block|modify",
  "reason": "Human-readable explanation",
  "modifications": {
    "file_path": "suggested changes"
  }
}
```

#### Security and Risk Management

**Security Considerations**:
**Automatic Command Execution**: Hooks execute shell commands without user intervention
- Users are "solely responsible for the commands you configure"
- Thorough testing in isolated environments recommended
- Regular security audits of hook configurations required
- Principle of least privilege for hook operations

**Best Practices for Safe Implementation**:
- **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only necessary permissions to hook scripts
- **Sandboxing**: Test hooks in isolated development environments
- **Audit Trails**: Implement comprehensive logging for all hook executions
- **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and update hook configurations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to prevent system failures

### 3. Sub-Agents System

**Installation**: `npm install -g @webdevtoday/claude-agents`

**Available Agents**:
1. **Code Quality**: Code Reviewer, Refactor Assistant, Security Scanner
2. **Testing**: Test Runner, TDD Specialist, Debugger

## Agent Systems

### Core Agent Types

```
simple-tool-creator  # Single component creation (Tools: Read, Write, MultiEdit, Glob, Bash)
tool-optimizer      # Performance & code optimization (Tools: Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash)  
tool-reviewer        # Quality review & improvements (Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit, MultiEdit)
parallel-developer   # Coordinates 3+ components (Tools: Task, TodoWrite, Bash, Read)
tool-orchestrator    # End-to-end lifecycles (Tools: Task, Read, Write, MultiEdit, Glob, Bash, TodoWrite)
general-purpose      # Research & complex tasks (Tools: *)
```

### Agent Selection Decision Tree

```
Task Complexity Assessment:
â”œâ”€ Single component/feature?
â”‚   â”œâ”€ New creation â†’ simple-tool-creator
â”‚   â”œâ”€ Performance issue â†’ tool-optimizer
â”‚   â””â”€ Quality review â†’ tool-reviewer
â”œâ”€ Multiple related components (3-10)?
â”‚   â”œâ”€ Similar components â†’ parallel-developer
â”‚   â””â”€ Complete feature â†’ tool-orchestrator  
â”œâ”€ Research/unknown scope?
â”‚   â””â”€ general-purpose
â””â”€ Large system (10+ components)?
    â””â”€ tool-orchestrator + parallel-developer coordination
```

### Success Metrics by Agent Type

| Agent Type | Typical Success Rate | Time per Task | Best Use Cases |
|------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| simple-tool-creator | 95% | 5-10 min | Components, utilities |
| tool-optimizer | 90% | 10-15 min | Performance fixes, refactoring |
| tool-reviewer | 85% | 15-20 min | Code quality, security review |
| parallel-developer | 80% | 30-45 min | Component batches, related features |
| tool-orchestrator | 75% | 60+ min | Complete features, systems |

### Task Coordination

#### Parallel Execution Patterns

**Standard Parallel Pattern**:
```bash
# Single message with multiple Task() calls
Task(simple-tool-creator) "Create authentication component"
Task(simple-tool-creator) "Create validation utility"
Task(simple-tool-creator) "Create error handler"
# All execute in parallel automatically
```

**Staggered Execution (Reduces Terminal Flickering)**:
```bash
# For 10+ components, use internal delays
Task(simple-tool-creator) "Component 1"
# Internal 2-second delay
Task(simple-tool-creator) "Component 2"  
# Pattern continues...
```

**Coordinated Multi-Agent**:
```bash
# Use orchestrator to manage complex workflows
Task(tool-orchestrator) "Create authentication system with login, signup, password reset"
# Orchestrator internally manages:
# â”œâ”€ Task(simple-tool-creator) "Login component"
# â”œâ”€ Task(simple-tool-creator) "Signup component"  
# â”œâ”€ Task(tool-reviewer) "Security review"
# â””â”€ Task(tool-optimizer) "Performance optimization"
```

### Task Coordination Limits

- **Parallel Limit**: 10 concurrent tasks maximum
- **Queue System**: Additional tasks automatically queue
- **Batch Processing**: Completes batches before starting next
- **Context Isolation**: Each task maintains independent context
- **Connection Errors**: 90% success rate on simple retry

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

**Specialized Agent Deployment:**
```bash
# Specialized agent deployment for enterprise workflows
claude --agent=frontend "Implement responsive design updates"
claude --agent=backend "Update API authentication middleware"  
claude --agent=testing "Generate comprehensive integration tests"
claude --agent=docs "Update API documentation"
```

**Context Preservation Strategies:**
- **Living Documentation**: CLAUDE.md files that evolve with project
- **Decision Capture**: Automated recording of architectural decisions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Systematic documentation of reasoning and rationale
- **Institutional Memory**: Building organizational knowledge through Claude interactions

## Error Recovery

### Common Error Patterns & Solutions

#### Connection Errors (Network Issues)
```bash
# Error: "Connection error" during Task execution
# Solution: Simple retry with same command
Task(simple-tool-creator) "retry same creation"
# Success rate: 90% on first retry
```

#### Hook Failures (Path Issues)
```bash
# Error: "command not found" in hooks
# Cause: Spaces in file paths not properly quoted
# Solution: Update hook script with proper quoting
command="/path/with spaces/script.sh"  # Wrong
command="/path/with\ spaces/script.sh" # Correct
```

#### Validation Failures (Build Issues)
```bash
# Error: Build fails after changes
# Investigation: Check specific error in hook output
# Common fixes:
# - Missing dependencies
# - Syntax errors in code
# - Invalid configuration
```

#### Context Overflow (Memory Issues)
```bash
# Error: Context too large for model
# Solution: Use /compact command to reduce context
/compact "focus on current task"
# Or restart with essential context only
```

### Recovery Strategies

#### Progressive Recovery
```bash
1. Identify failure point from TodoWrite status
2. Resume with same agent type at failure point
3. If repeated failure, escalate to tool-orchestrator
4. Last resort: manual intervention with context preservation
```

#### Context Recovery
```bash
# Lost session recovery
claude -c                    # Continue last session
claude -r "session-id"       # Resume specific session

# Context reconstruction  
Task(general-purpose) "Analyze current state and recent changes"
# Rebuilds working understanding
```
